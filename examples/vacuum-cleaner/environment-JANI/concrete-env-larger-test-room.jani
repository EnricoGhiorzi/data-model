// The environment model describes a room with three straight edges and one edge with a small corner in the middle.
// In addition, there are two obstacles placed in the room, a ball, which is movable, and a fixed cube.
// The robot is placed at coordinates (0.5, 0.5) initially, and has a round shape with a radius of 0.3m and a height of 0.2m.
// Lengths are given in meters.
// This is only the environment part of the model, i.e., it is an excerpt of a fully functional model describing the entire setup of the full robot behavior in the environment.
// The environment model is the same as drawn in Deliverable D4.1 in Section 5 in Figure 10
